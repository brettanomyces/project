## PROJECT

Project is a tool to help track spending and manage budgets. 

Project is also a side project for me to try out different technologies.
I choose to implement a financial tool because it is something that will be useful for the rest of my life so I will be motivated to keep working on it.

### Technologies

* Git
* Spring Boot
* Maven
* Thymeleaf
* NPM
* MithrilJS

### Dev Journal

One goal of this project is to be able to re-implement parts of it

Another goal is to have a fast development cycle
